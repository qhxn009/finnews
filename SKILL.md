## How to Use (browser_use)

1. **Clarify the user's need**: Determine which category or categories (politics / finance / society / world / tech / sports / entertainment), or pick 1–2 to fetch.
2. **Pick the URL**: Use the URL from the table for that category; for multiple categories, repeat the steps below for each URL.
3. **Open the page**: Call **browser_use** with:
   ```json
   {"action": "open", "url": "https://www.chinanews.com/society/"}
   ```
   Replace `url` with the corresponding URL from the table.
4. **Take a snapshot**: In the same session, call **browser_use** again:
   ```json
   {"action": "snapshot"}
   ```
   Extract headlines, dates, and summaries from the returned page content.
5. **Summarize the reply**: Organize a short list (headline + one or two sentences + source) by time or importance; if a site is unreachable or times out, say so and suggest another source.

## Notes

- Page structure may change when sites are updated; if extraction fails, say so and suggest the user open the link directly.
- When visiting multiple categories, run `open` for each URL, then `snapshot`, to avoid mixing content from different pages.
- You may include the original link in the reply so the user can open it.
